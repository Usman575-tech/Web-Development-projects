            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is a multi-part assignment with the objective of making you comfortable working with HTML and CSS.
                By the end of this assignment: you will have styled some rectangular blocks and created a simple version
                of Twitter's home page.</p>
            <p>If this assignment seems overwhelming to you, please come see a TA at TA hours to talk through some
                strategies for tackling it. We expect this assignment to be a time-consuming assignment as we cover a
                lot of fundamental techiniques_ But with a good strategy: it can be finished in a reasonable amount of
                time.</p>
            <p>Note: Only CSS and HTML will be used for this assignment. If you want to use Java Script (or libraries
                such as puery) then feel free to, but we will only be grading correctness on your CSS and HTML.</p>
            <p>If you can: Start Early!</p>

            <h2>Part One</h2>
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <p>Now that you understand some of the basics of HTML and CSS: let's take a look at how to align HT it
                elements_ There are multiple ways to align HTML elements, but in this part, we recommend using fiexboxes
                as they are widely used in modern web development (for example BootstrapV4 is built on top of
                flexboxes).</p>
            <p>Refer to this great webpage on how to use flexboxes: <span>CSS Flexbox Guide</span></p>
            <p>Also feel free to use online resources such as Stack Overflow, MDN, W3, and Google for reference.</p>
            <p>When you open the provided HTML file <code>part1/index.html</code>, It should look like this:</p>
            <h4>Assignment 1</h4>

            <p>As you can see: there are 9 rectangles. The styling and makeup of the first two rectangles are already
                built for you. Your task is to apply stylings and add div elements inside of the next 7 green
                rectangular blocks to create a webpage that looks like this</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We will describe how each row will behave dynamically and provide some hints for a possible approach</p>
            <div class="pera">
                <p> 3 For the third row, the red and blue end rectangles should remain the same width, and the green
                    space should shrink

                    Possible Approach: Have a div yvith a red background and a div with a blue background, both with
                    fixed width. Use an appropriate value for <span>Justify Content</span>
                </p>
                <p> 4 For the fourth row: the blue end rectangle should remain the same width. and the red rectangle
                    should shrink

                    Possible Approach: Have a div with a red background and a div with a blue background. Have a fixed
                    width on the blue thy. Use <span>Flex Grow</span></li>
                <p>
                    5 For the fifth row, the red square should remain the same size, but always remain in the center of
                    the green rectangle. Hint: Think about how to keep a div fixed size and how to align something in
                    the absolute center of the parent element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6 For the sixth row, the blue rectangle should remain the same size; while the red rectangles should
                    shrink. The blue rectangle should remain in the center of the row. Hint.- Use two red divs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7 For the seventh row: the red rectangle should remain the same width. br Hint: Nest divs and use
                    <code>background- color:transparent</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    8 For the eighth row. the orange rectangles should remain the same size while the green space
                    between them shrinks
                </p>
                <p>
                    9 For the ninth row, the green space between the orange rectangles should remain the same width
                    while the orange rectangles narrow
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The examples we provided with the first two rectangular blocks use flexboxes. You are not required to use
                flexboxes for the next 7 rows. but we recommend it as it will also be useful in part 2 of this
                assignment</p>
            <p>You should only have to use the <div>div</div> htmr element to complete this assignment. Also. none of the divs you
                create inside of the provided wrapper divs should have <code>background-color: green;</code>But it is valid to
                specify non-green background colors for any divs, including the wrapper</p>
            <p>Try to style The boxes as closely to the solution image as possible don't worry about getting exact
                dimensions or rgb values. We care about what structure: CSS styles you used. and the dynamic behavior of
                the page. However just for reference.
            <ul>
                <li>The color of the boxes we used are <code>background-color:</code> <span id="red">red</span>, <span id="blue">blue</span> and <span id="orange">orange</span></li>
                <li>Some width..beight values we used are <code>21px, 40px, 80px</code></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You are not required to use Bootstrap in this part. You can use if you want, but we actually recommend
                writing plain S. Just for this part, inline CSS is acceptable, but you should generally avoid using
                inline CSS in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>General Notes</h2>
            <p>As a reminder. it's a good idea to run your HTML and CSS syntax through validators. You should also
                consider using an accessibility checker such as WAVE.</p>
            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>There are hundreds of HTML and CSS tags: properties: and values, and we do not expect students to learn
                each one by heart. However, this assignment and the first lab are intended for you to intuitivel.:./
                understand the languages. and to be proficient at knowing how to tackle a design by the end of the
                semester.</p>
            <p>If you're having problems. there are many guides on HTML and CSS online (CSSTricks and MDIA are your
                friends), as well as on our resources page.</p>
            <p>As always, if you are stuck on a particular part, you can always talk to the friendly TAs or ask
                questions on course piazza (check your email for a signup link).</p>
            <p>As a general rule of thumb, do not expect TAs to be able to solve every web problem you have. Even the
                most adept web developer can struggle a lot with specific CSS rules to use.</p>
